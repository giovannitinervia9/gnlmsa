\title{Create mapping functions between open intervals and the real line}
\usage{
map_interval()
}
\value{
A list of six functions: \code{map}, \code{invert}, \code{map_jacobian},
\code{map_hessian}, \code{invert_jacobian}, \code{invert_hessian}.
}
\description{
Returns a list of functions implementing a bijective transformation between
an open interval \verb{(lower, upper)} and the real line, together with their derivatives and inverses.
}
\details{
The returned list contains:
\describe{
\item{map(x, lower, upper)}{Maps from (lower, upper) to the real line: \eqn{f(x) = \log\left(\frac{x - \texttt{lower}}{\texttt{upper} - x}\right)}}
\item{invert(x, lower, upper)}{Inverse mapping: \eqn{f^{-1}(z) = \frac{\texttt{lower} + \texttt{upper} \cdot e^z}{1 + e^z}}}
\item{map_jacobian(x, lower, upper)}{First derivative of the forward map: \eqn{f'(x) = \frac{\texttt{upper} - \texttt{lower}}{(x - \texttt{lower})(\texttt{upper} - x)}}}
\item{map_hessian(x, lower, upper)}{Second derivative of the forward map: \eqn{f''(x) = -\frac{(\texttt{lower} - \texttt{upper})(\texttt{lower} + \texttt{upper} - 2x)}{(x - \texttt{lower})^2 (\texttt{upper} - x)^2}}}
\item{invert_jacobian(x, lower, upper)}{First derivative of the inverse map (with respect to z).}
\item{invert_hessian(x, lower, upper)}{Second derivative of the inverse map (with respect to z).}
