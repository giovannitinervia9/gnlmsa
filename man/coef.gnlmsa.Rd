\title{Extract Model Coefficients from a Generalized Non-Linear Model}
\usage{
\method{coef}{gnlmsa}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"gnlmsa"}, typically returned by \code{\link[=gnlmsa]{gnlmsa()}}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of model coefficients.
}
\description{
Returns the estimated model coefficients from a fitted Generalized Non-Linear Model (GNLM)
object of class \code{"gnlmsa"}.
}
\details{
This function extracts and returns the estimated coefficients for both the mean and dispersion components,
combined into a single named numeric vector.

The coefficients are returned on the original (constrained) parameter space.
